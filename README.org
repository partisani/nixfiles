* My NixOS Configuration

This is the second rewrite of my NixOS configuration,
fully working with Wayland and (in the future) X11,

** Structure

As you can see (i think), there are a number of directories:

- The ~hosts/~ directory contains files/directories
  for all the machines this configuration is going
  to run in.
- The ~modules/~ directory contains files/directories
  that encapsulate some behaviour and can be imported
  into a host via ~inputs.modules~.
- The ~utils/~ directory is the home for a custom
  library i wrote, that makes this sort of /automagic/
  configuration possible.
